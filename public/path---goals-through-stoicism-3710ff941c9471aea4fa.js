If you are starting a business, your goal might be to generate X amount of\nrevenue in your first year.</p>\n<p>The problem with these types of goals is that they are only loosely correlated with our own actions.\nThe majority of businesses will fail within five years.  If we make our goal centered around\nthe success of a business, we are concerning ourself with something that is fully not up to us.</p>\n<p>Instead, if we focus our goal only around what we can control, we remove the fear and anxiety that comes with focusing on things that we cannot control.  This could be as simple as spending focused time\non or business, or learning something new about business each day.</p>\n<p>When we reframe our goals in this way, suddenly starting your first business becomes a lot less scary.\nIf the business fails, you didn\'t fail.</p>\n<p>As long as you reached your goal of learning something new,\nor spent focused time on your business everyday, then starting your business was actually a massive success.</p>\n<p>How can you reframe your focus so that you win regardless of what happens outside of your control?</p>\n<p>Note: This post was inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011T71D4Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B011T71D4Y&linkCode=as2&tag=myblog06bf-20&linkId=3251db38c76da37dc0cd72c94422bab9">A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</a></p>\n<p>If you\'re interested in learning more about stoicism, I highly recommend checking out this book as well as these other resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Nonfiction/The-Tao-of-Seneca-Audiobook/B01AIXEJKU">The Tao of Seneca: Practical Letters from a Stoic Master</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/The-Obstacle-Is-the-Way-Audiobook/B00K252ET8/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1399406050&#x26;sr=1-1">The Obstacle Is The Way</a> by Ryan Holiday</li>\n</ul>',frontmatter:{path:"/goals-through-stoicism",title:"Goals through the lens of stoicism",date:"2017-04-07T00:00:00.000Z",tag:"Philosophy"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
