Source: <a href=\\\"https://assets.themuse.com/uploaded/companies/295/office/414/f1.jpg?v=None\\\">The Muse</a></h4>\\n<p>My notebook is already cluttered with various keyboard commands for vim, tmux, as well as Mac OSX as a whole.</p>\\n<p>All development here is done within tmux/vim using a setup we call <a href=\\\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/vimux-simple-vim-and-tmux-integration/\\\">vimux</a>. You have to get up to speed fast.</p>\\n<p>I still have a long way to go, but here's what I've been doing to get proficient at navigating vim as quickly as possible.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Go through <a href=\\\"http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/vimtutor1.html\\\">vimtutor</a> every day. The first time through might take you awhile but after each iteration you get a little faster.  I've been doing this and it's probably the thing that's helped me the most.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Whenever you have a few minutes to kill, pop open a window in vim.  Practice navigating around to drill shortcuts into your head.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Ask.  During pairing sessions, anytime my partner did something super useful that I didn't know how to do, I would ask what shortcut he used, and then jot it down in a notebook. Practice using these whenever you get the chance.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Transition to using only vim, even for projects outside of work.  After a few days of vimtutor, you'll probably reach the level where you can do all of your development with vim.  You might be a little slow at first, but that's okay.  I recently made this switch myself, and I can already tell it will pay dividends.  Plus, there's something so satisfying about correctly using a cool keyboard shortcut.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>You are enough.</h2>\\n<p>I won't lie, the first few days of the internship were stressful.</p>\\n<p>I was jumping into a new work environment, working with technologies I've never touched, on a scale that none of my projects have come remotely close to.</p>\\n<p>By the end of my first two days, I was finding it tough to not get down on myself.</p>\\n<p>What can I possibly offer to Braintree when I am surrounded by people that know so much more than me?  What if I'm not good enough?  How will I ever reach the level of everyone around me?</p>\\n<p>If you've ever felt this way in any facet of your life, I think it's helpful to take a step back.</p>\\n<p>Regardless of who you are or what you're doing, you have something unique to offer.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 105.86538461538461%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"coffee\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-300e3.jpg 1200w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-3a622.jpg 2400w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-c1f12.jpg 3120w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"https://sightglasscoffee.com/\\\">Sightglass Coffee</a></h4>\\n<p>Rather than focusing on how far I have to go, I try to focus on what I can do every day to get a little bit better.</p>\\n<p>So what can I contribute to Braintree?</p>\\n<p>I'm still not sure, but I do know that I can bring energy, excitement, and a hunger to learn every day.</p>\\n<p>Exercise and meditation have also been extremely helpful for helping me get over the feeling of being overwhelmed.

She showed me around the area and took me out to my first meal in SF.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 177.77777777777777%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"poke\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/poke-cf682938c27f380f07959a256ba2a2dc-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/poke-cf682938c27f380f07959a256ba2a2dc-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/poke-cf682938c27f380f07959a256ba2a2dc-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/poke-cf682938c27f380f07959a256ba2a2dc-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/poke-cf682938c27f380f07959a256ba2a2dc-f04a1.jpg 1080w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"https://pacificcatch.com\\\">Pacific Catch</a></h4>\\n<p>I got a poke bowl.

This week I got my personal computer setup for RoR development and started working through <a href=\\\"https://www.railstutorial.org/\\\">this</a> book.</p>\\n<p>So far I'm really enjoying the change of pace from the full-stack javascript world.</p>\\n<p>Rails gets you up and running super quickly, and it's interesting to look at the differences from the node/express approach I'm used to.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"food\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-300e3.jpg 1200w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-3a622.jpg 2400w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-c1f12.jpg 3120w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>Sometimes I cook things</h4>\\n<h3>Here's a few miscellaneous resources that I've found helpful to learn about some of the other technologies I'll be using this summer:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-containers-vms-and-docker-79a9e3e119b\\\">A Beginner-Friendly Introduction to Containers, VMs and Docker</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/tag/kafka/\\\">Apache Kafka</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://vim.rtorr.com/\\\">More Vim</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Open Dev Day</h3>\\n<p>Every other Friday at Braintree is <a href=\\\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/walking-the-talk-open-dev-time-at-braintree/\\\">Open Dev Day</a>.  Essentially that means that you get to spend the day exploring whatever you want and building something cool.  The first one of my internship is this Friday.</p>\\n<p>I'm still thinking out ideas.  If you have any thoughts about something you think would be cool/fun to build, let me know.</p>\\n<h2>Podcast</h2>\\n<p>I'm still working towards making this happen.  I reached out to another potential guest this weekend and I'm continuing to work on questions for my outline.</p>\\n<p>The more I learn about voice and Alexa as a technology, the more I see it as a huge opportunity.  Gary Vaynerchuck recently published an article about [The Rise of Audio &#x26; Voice](The Rise of Audio &#x26; Voice).  If you have some extra time, it's worth the read.</p>\\n<p>Amazon is doing a huge <a href=\\\"https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-developer-skill-promotion\\\">promotion</a> for the month of June to give an echo dot to anyone who publishes an Alexa skill.  Whether you are a developer or not, I highly reccommend taking an hour to work through one of the <a href=\\\"https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-skills-developer-training\\\">tutorials</a>, both for a free dot, and to get a better understand of the voice ecosystem.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>That's all for this week folks.

Source: <a href=\\\"https://assets.themuse.com/uploaded/companies/295/office/414/f1.jpg?v=None\\\">The Muse</a></h4>\\n<p>My notebook is already cluttered with various keyboard commands for vim, tmux, as well as Mac OSX as a whole.</p>\\n<p>All development here is done within tmux/vim using a setup we call <a href=\\\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/vimux-simple-vim-and-tmux-integration/\\\">vimux</a>. You have to get up to speed fast.</p>\\n<p>I still have a long way to go, but here's what I've been doing to get proficient at navigating vim as quickly as possible.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Go through <a href=\\\"http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/vimtutor1.html\\\">vimtutor</a> every day. The first time through might take you awhile but after each iteration you get a little faster.  I've been doing this and it's probably the thing that's helped me the most.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Whenever you have a few minutes to kill, pop open a window in vim.  Practice navigating around to drill shortcuts into your head.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Ask.  During pairing sessions, anytime my partner did something super useful that I didn't know how to do, I would ask what shortcut he used, and then jot it down in a notebook. Practice using these whenever you get the chance.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Transition to using only vim, even for projects outside of work.  After a few days of vimtutor, you'll probably reach the level where you can do all of your development with vim.  You might be a little slow at first, but that's okay.  I recently made this switch myself, and I can already tell it will pay dividends.  Plus, there's something so satisfying about correctly using a cool keyboard shortcut.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>You are enough.</h2>\\n<p>I won't lie, the first few days of the internship were stressful.</p>\\n<p>I was jumping into a new work environment, working with technologies I've never touched, on a scale that none of my projects have come remotely close to.</p>\\n<p>By the end of my first two days, I was finding it tough to not get down on myself.</p>\\n<p>What can I possibly offer to Braintree when I am surrounded by people that know so much more than me?  What if I'm not good enough?  How will I ever reach the level of everyone around me?</p>\\n<p>If you've ever felt this way in any facet of your life, I think it's helpful to take a step back.</p>\\n<p>Regardless of who you are or what you're doing, you have something unique to offer.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 105.86538461538461%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"coffee\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-300e3.jpg 1200w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-3a622.jpg 2400w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-c1f12.jpg 3120w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"https://sightglasscoffee.com/\\\">Sightglass Coffee</a></h4>\\n<p>Rather than focusing on how far I have to go, I try to focus on what I can do every day to get a little bit better.</p>\\n<p>So what can I contribute to Braintree?</p>\\n<p>I'm still not sure, but I do know that I can bring energy, excitement, and a hunger to learn every day.</p>\\n<p>Exercise and meditation have also been extremely helpful for helping me get over the feeling of being overwhelmed.

This week I got my personal computer setup for RoR development and started working through <a href=\\\"https://www.railstutorial.org/\\\">this</a> book.</p>\\n<p>So far I'm really enjoying the change of pace from the full-stack javascript world.</p>\\n<p>Rails gets you up and running super quickly, and it's interesting to look at the differences from the node/express approach I'm used to.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"food\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-300e3.jpg 1200w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-3a622.jpg 2400w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-c1f12.jpg 3120w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>Sometimes I cook things</h4>\\n<h3>Here's a few miscellaneous resources that I've found helpful to learn about some of the other technologies I'll be using this summer:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-containers-vms-and-docker-79a9e3e119b\\\">A Beginner-Friendly Introduction to Containers, VMs and Docker</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/tag/kafka/\\\">Apache Kafka</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://vim.rtorr.com/\\\">More Vim</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Open Dev Day</h3>\\n<p>Every other Friday at Braintree is <a href=\\\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/walking-the-talk-open-dev-time-at-braintree/\\\">Open Dev Day</a>.  Essentially that means that you get to spend the day exploring whatever you want and building something cool.  The first one of my internship is this Friday.</p>\\n<p>I'm still thinking out ideas.  If you have any thoughts about something you think would be cool/fun to build, let me know.</p>\\n<h2>Podcast</h2>\\n<p>I'm still working towards making this happen.  I reached out to another potential guest this weekend and I'm continuing to work on questions for my outline.</p>\\n<p>The more I learn about voice and Alexa as a technology, the more I see it as a huge opportunity.  Gary Vaynerchuck recently published an article about [The Rise of Audio &#x26; Voice](The Rise of Audio &#x26; Voice).  If you have some extra time, it's worth the read.</p>\\n<p>Amazon is doing a huge <a href=\\\"https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-developer-skill-promotion\\\">promotion</a> for the month of June to give an echo dot to anyone who publishes an Alexa skill.  Whether you are a developer or not, I highly reccommend taking an hour to work through one of the <a href=\\\"https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-skills-developer-training\\\">tutorials</a>, both for a free dot, and to get a better understand of the voice ecosystem.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>That's all for this week folks.  Check back next week for more updates and fun stories.  Thanks for being here.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/interning-in-sf-week-1\",\"title\":\"I survived my first week!
