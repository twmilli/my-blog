I get it, sharing a room with a bunch of other young interns sounds kind of crazy (it is), but the benefits extend far beyond saving a little extra cash.</p>\\n<p>I'll be honest, I really had no idea what I was getting myself into in terms of housing before I came here.  Airbnb deals can be kinda sketchy.  If I hadn't ended up with such a great group of people, things easily could have ended up much worse than they have.</p>\\n<p>We often joke that we're not quite sure how everything works out as well as it does, but somehow it does.</p>\\n<p>We share food, organize events as a house (steak night), and do things I never would have known about without them.

We laid out a clear plan, and so far we're executing on it.</p>\\n<p>This week was working through the first two chapters of CTCI, which focus on Arrays, Strings, and Linked Lists.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Cool street pic\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/street-23f1478b844e744ca930c36f749bc235-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/street-23f1478b844e744ca930c36f749bc235-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/street-23f1478b844e744ca930c36f749bc235-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/street-23f1478b844e744ca930c36f749bc235-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/street-23f1478b844e744ca930c36f749bc235-300e3.jpg 1200w,\\n/static/street-23f1478b844e744ca930c36f749bc235-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\\n/static/street-23f1478b844e744ca930c36f749bc235-3a622.jpg 2400w,\\n/static/street-23f1478b844e744ca930c36f749bc235-646e8.jpg 4160w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p>To any other tech interns reading this, feel free to hit us up if you'd like to be apart of our accountability group.

SF seemed like an exciting place to live for 10 weeks, but probably not somewhere that I would want to live.</p>\\n<p>Now, well, I still have no idea where I want to live after I graduate, but I can safely say the San Francisco has earned it's way into the mix.</p>\\n<p>Here's the highlights of the past week or so.</p>\\n<h2>Co-Living is awesome</h2>\\n<p>Whenever I bring a friend over to my apartment, they are so quick to judge.</p>\\n<p>\\\"How can you possibly live with so many other people in such a small area?\\\"</p>\\n<p>At best, they see it as a reasonable sacrifice that I make in order to save money.  I get it, sharing a room with a bunch of other young interns sounds kind of crazy (it is), but the benefits extend far beyond saving a little extra cash.</p>\\n<p>I'll be honest, I really had no idea what I was getting myself into in terms of housing before I came here.  Airbnb deals can be kinda sketchy.  If I hadn't ended up with such a great group of people, things easily could have ended up much worse than they have.</p>\\n<p>We often joke that we're not quite sure how everything works out as well as it does, but somehow it does.</p>\\n<p>We share food, organize events as a house (steak night), and do things I never would have known about without them.  As a write this, a group of us are getting ready to head to a festival in North Beach.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Street art\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/art-2b877c765f72c53cb2600b53df7a280c-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/art-2b877c765f72c53cb2600b53df7a280c-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/art-2b877c765f72c53cb2600b53df7a280c-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/art-2b877c765f72c53cb2600b53df7a280c-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/art-2b877c765f72c53cb2600b53df7a280c-300e3.jpg 1200w,\\n/static/art-2b877c765f72c53cb2600b53df7a280c-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\\n/static/art-2b877c765f72c53cb2600b53df7a280c-3a622.jpg 2400w,\\n/static/art-2b877c765f72c53cb2600b53df7a280c-c1f12.jpg 3120w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>Street art at North Beach</h4>\\n<p>There's even talk of a 4th of July weekend trip to Tahoe....we'll see if someone actually follows through on planning that one.</p>\\n<p>If you're coming to San Francisco, especially as an intern, I cannot recommend co-living enough.

They graciously shared their rooftop and life stories with me and 3 other interns.</p>\\n<p>In a world where we are surrounded by so many people that we will never get to know, there is something immensely refreshing about sharing a meal with a group of strangers.</p>\\n<p>The couple grew up in the area, and get this: they even dated in middle school!  The other interns were also from California and spending their summers working at Amazon and Quora.</p>\\n<p>They kept us entertained, sharing stories about growing up in the city, their <a href=\\\"https://www.saintfrankcoffee.com/\\\">favorite coffee shop</a> and restaurants, and lastly some <a href=\\\"https://www.itsiticecream.com/\\\">It's-Its</a> (would recommend).</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 36.25128733264676%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Ice Cream Sandwhich\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/itsit-bfe0c56aef5668ea40bb0ae155a0198d-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/itsit-bfe0c56aef5668ea40bb0ae155a0198d-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/itsit-bfe0c56aef5668ea40bb0ae155a0198d-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/itsit-bfe0c56aef5668ea40bb0ae155a0198d-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/itsit-bfe0c56aef5668ea40bb0ae155a0198d-2586b.jpg 971w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>It's-It.

The company list, as well as the speaker line up is pretty incredible.</p>\\n<p>I'm most excited to see <a href=\\\"http://www.andrewng.org/\\\">Andrew Ng</a> talk.</p>\\n<p>For those unfamiliar, he's the co-founder of <a href=\\\"https://www.coursera.org/\\\">Coursera</a> as well as a professor at Stanford, where he taught one of the most widely respected courses on <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E&#x26;list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599\\\">machine learning</a> (It's free too!).</p>\\n<p>I can't wait to tell you all about it.</p>\\n<h2>Interview Prep</h2>\\n<p>Shoutout to my boy Yash for finally getting me going on interview prep this week.
