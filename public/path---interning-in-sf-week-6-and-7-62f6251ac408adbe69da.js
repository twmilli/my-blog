This leads to what the founder likes to refer to as "dirty sock" flavor. The more you know.</p>\n<p>From there, he sat us down for a presentation on the history of coffee, Saint Frank\'s, and most importantly, the coffee producers with which he works directly.</p>\n<p>If you\'re a big coffee drinker, it\'s fascinating to learn how complex the process is that takes a green coffee bean to the cup of coffee that you consume every day.</p>\n<p>Saint Frank\'s works closely with Farmer\'s in Honduras, Guatemala, and places around the globe to improve their livelihood, and make fantastic coffee in the process.</p>\n<p>By the end of the presentation, I could feel his passion running through me.  There were a few times where I legitimately\nthought that he might come to tears talking about the farmers he works with, and the impact that he has made on their lives.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I want people to drink less coffee, but better coffee.  Less coffee, but more expensive coffee.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He had me sold.  Our purchasing power matters, and the more we treat coffee as a commodity, the more we hurt the livelihood of the people making it.  Sure coffee is kind of a commodity, but if you\'ve tasted a variety of well crafted coffee, you know that coffee\'s from different places can taste radically different.</p>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAbABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDBAH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB3NmdLChipykVOFf/xAAaEAACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEAACERIh/9oACAEBAAEFAmb4gsjywOxQX//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAR/9oACAEDAQE/ASn/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAECAQE/AR//xAAYEAACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARIAABEP/aAAgBAQAGPwJBhlBf/8QAHBAAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAECBBMVFh/9oACAEBAAE/IXYPROo0sEaJZ8JTpQbx/wD/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEIci/v/EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBIP/aAAgBAwEBPxAo4f/EABgRAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABARASEx/9oACAECAQE/EHGBWP/EABsQAQADAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESEQMXFB/9oACAEBAAE/ECTihEekJfv+e2PjBZWBdiF1twO6e2meQc4EHJ//2Q==\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="latte art"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-631b1.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-30fbd.jpg 200w,\n/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-e87dc.jpg 400w,\n/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-631b1.jpg 800w,\n/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-300e3.jpg 1200w,\n/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\n/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-3a622.jpg 2400w,\n/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-c1f12.jpg 3120w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<h4>Turns out the owner also makes some pretty decent lattes</h4>\n<p>If at this point you\'re thinking that this is just another pretentious SF coffee shop charging $5 for a coffee, I get it,\nbut I have to disagree.</p>\n<p>When I finally tasted the four coffees that had been prepared for the tour, I got it.

The focus is on the coffee.  There are\ndozens of shops in SF that they are competing with, but Saint Frank\'s has earned a reputation by having a ruthless focus on a simple goal: producing the best cup of coffee they possibly can.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/therealinternsf/">The Real Intern</a> for making this event happen.</p>\n<p>Since then, my roommate Tyler and I have been brainstorming ideas for how we can encourage others to discover the deliciousness of high-end coffees, and to share them with others.</p>\n<p>A few of our early ideas include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://untappd.com/">Untapped</a> but for coffee</li>\n<li>A beautiful way to search coffee\'s by a number of categories including notes. Some websites similar to this\nalready exist, but I\'m pretty sure we could do it better.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also listened to a highly entertaining podcast about <a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/">Blue Bottle\'s</a> sixteen dollar cup of coffee.

Afterwards I couldn\'t resist going to <a href="http://www.azucarsf.com/">Azucar Lounge</a>\nwith a few of my roommates for five dollar margaritas.  It\'s safe to say we celebrated Taco Tuesday in full force.</p>\n<h2>What I Wish I Know @20</h2>\n<p>Braintree held a fun panel Q &#x26; A event on Wednesday about career tips and life advice for interns all over the Bay Area.</p>\n<p>It was a fun chance to talk with fellow interns at google, twitter, stripe and other tech companies about what they\'re working on.  Like most advice, it was nothing earth-shattering, but it was fun to hear a diversity of perspectives.</p>\n<h2>Luck</h2>\n<p>During the event, an intern asked "I feel like I could attribute all of my successes in my short career to luck, how do you think about luck?"</p>\n<p>I wasn\'t asked the question, but it got me thinking about my answer.  The odds of any of us becoming humans, being born in the U.S, and somehow ending up in San Francisco during one of the most exciting time periods ever (in my person opinion) are ridiculous.</p>\n<p>It\'s this incredible combination of things that I hope I can always stay thankful for.</p>\n<p>But that being said, I\'m not sure it\'s ever helpful for us to believe that our life is ruled by luck.  Even if there is no way to know, it seems better to assume that we as individuals are control of our future, so that we will act in the most beneficial way (ideally for ourselves and for society) as we possibly can.</p>\n<p>You are not a lottery ticket.</p>\n<p>Luck undoubtedly plays a massive role in our lives, but what matters it was we do with it.  One of my favorite podcast episodes, which I recently re-listened to, talks about this philosophy.</p>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Exploring Buena Vista Park"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/buenavista-f8cb11933124d1bbb0cdfa02622a53c2-631b1.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/buenavista-f8cb11933124d1bbb0cdfa02622a53c2-30fbd.jpg 200w,\n/static/buenavista-f8cb11933124d1bbb0cdfa02622a53c2-e87dc.jpg 400w,\n/static/buenavista-f8cb11933124d1bbb0cdfa02622a53c2-631b1.jpg 800w,\n/static/buenavista-f8cb11933124d1bbb0cdfa02622a53c2-300e3.jpg 1200w,\n/static/buenavista-f8cb11933124d1bbb0cdfa02622a53c2-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\n/static/buenavista-f8cb11933124d1bbb0cdfa02622a53c2-e49fc.jpg 1944w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<h4>Exploring Buena Vista</h4>\n<p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/02/12/10-philosophies-for-developers/">SEDaily - Ten philosophies for developers</a></p>\n<p>Software engineer or not, I think it\'s worth the listen.</p>\n<h2>Lassen National Park</h2>\n<p>My parents arrived Thursday night and promptly took me out to Roti (thanks Alix for the recommendation.

Crazy to think places are still feeling the effects of the record setting snowfall this year.</p>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Rainbow Lake"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/rainbowlake-455c7bf98fd9456e1f32b289b81da4ed-631b1.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/rainbowlake-455c7bf98fd9456e1f32b289b81da4ed-30fbd.jpg 200w,\n/static/rainbowlake-455c7bf98fd9456e1f32b289b81da4ed-e87dc.jpg 400w,\n/static/rainbowlake-455c7bf98fd9456e1f32b289b81da4ed-631b1.jpg 800w,\n/static/rainbowlake-455c7bf98fd9456e1f32b289b81da4ed-300e3.jpg 1200w,\n/static/rainbowlake-455c7bf98fd9456e1f32b289b81da4ed-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\n/static/rainbowlake-455c7bf98fd9456e1f32b289b81da4ed-3a622.jpg 2400w,\n/static/rainbowlake-455c7bf98fd9456e1f32b289b81da4ed-c1f12.jpg 3120w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<h4>Rainbow Lake</h4>\n<p>After car camping Friday night, we pivoted Saturday and hiked into Rainbow lake where I took my 2nd nap of the trip (software development is hard work I guess?).

A fresh, young, excited perspective that an intern brings will always be valuable.</p>\n<p>Sure, the development time for my project has certainly taken longer than if two full-time employees were working on it, but we\'re still making steady progress and I\'m confident we\'ll be close to completion by the end of my internship.</p>\n<p>On top of that, even working as a software engineer, writing code is only of of the many ways you can provide value.  Want to write a blog post for the marketing team?  Go for it.  See a place where documentation could be improved?  Fix it yourself.  There are so many ways to add value, where you don\'t need years of experience to help the company.</p>\n<p>Last week, the interns also got to sit down with Juan Benitez, GM at Braintree.</p>\n<p>My favorite quote from the session was "Legacy code means you\'re doing something right".</p>\n<p>Simple, but I love it.  The Disputes team has only been around for ~2.5 years so I\'m lucky enough to not work with much legacy code, but for those working on Braintree\'s monolith, working with legacy code is a fact of daily life.</p>\n<p>At least for me, I love always working with the latest and hottest new technologies, but that\'s not always what\'s best for building a business.</p>\n<p>Having clean code is important, but at the end of the day your customers don\'t care what language you use or what the code looks like.</p>\n<p>This seems obvious, but it\'s easy to forget when you\'re buried in the details for the better part of each day.</p>\n<h2>Interviews</h2>\n<p>It\'s hard to believe, but recruiting for full-time positions starting summer 2018 has already begun.</p>\n<p>As far as prepping goes, I\'ve actually been fairly disciplined, all things considered.  My biggest areas of focus going forward are dynamic programming, searching and sorting, with a little graph theory on the side.</p>\n<p>I won\'t bore you with the details, but maybe if I actually end up doing well on interviews I can write up a more detailed post on what I have been doing at some point.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="sunset"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-631b1.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-30fbd.jpg 200w,\n/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-e87dc.jpg 400w,\n/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-631b1.jpg 800w,\n/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-300e3.jpg 1200w,\n/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\n/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-3a622.jpg 2400w,\n/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-646e8.jpg 4160w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time out of your day to read.
