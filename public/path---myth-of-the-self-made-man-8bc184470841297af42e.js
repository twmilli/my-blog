I found myself disagreeing with a lot of his views, but there was one passage that I found particularly interesting.</p>\n<p>"Class divisions are determined by fate, but individuals can rise out of their class through work, initiative, etc. This process, and the myth of the self-made man, has to be profoundly hypocritical: it is the self-serving demonstration that a lie is the truth."</p>\n<p>In a sense, I disagree with this idea because I believe we can make a difference by working to be the best we can be.  I do however agree that no individual can rise out of their class alone.</p>\n<p>It reminded me of Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s Foreword in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788">Tools of Titans</a>, <a href="http://tim.blog/2016/11/07/tools-of-titans-foreword-arnold-schwarzenegger-i-am-not-a-self-made-man/">"I Am Not A Self-Made Man"</a>.</p>\n<p>Here is one of my favorite excerpts:</p>\n<p> "It is not true that I am self-made. Like everyone, to get to where I am, I stood on the shoulders of giants. My life was built on a foundation of parents, coaches, and teachers; of kind souls who lent couches or gym back rooms where I could sleep; of mentors who shared wisdom and advice; of idols who motivated me from the pages of magazines."</p>\n<p>No one, not even Arnold Schwarzenegger can make this journey alone.  It\'s up to each of us to help each other out, not because we have to, but because we want to.</p>\n<p>What can you do today to help create the next "self-made man"?</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/myth-of-the-self-made-man",title:"The Myth of the Self-made Man",date:"5-1-2017",tag:"Philosophy"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
