It took nearly 20 minutes of helping him dig through his code before we found the issue.</p>\n<p>As usual, the bug was produced by a minute error. He had accidentally switched the order of two of the arguments\nin a function call.</p>\n<p>Immediately after we fixed the bug, and tested the code to make sure it was working, I felt a rush.\nAnyone who has ever felt the joy of fixing a frustrating bug can relate.  We both grinned, he submitted his code, and shook\nmy hand and thanked me for the help.</p>\n<p>Debugging is one of the most common things that I help students with.\nInterestingly, I actually know much less about their code than they do, but I\nam usually able to find the source of their issue not because of what I know,\nbut because of my mindset.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes your mindset can be even more important than what you know.</p>\n<p>Here\'s a link favorite podcast all about debugging.  Even if you don\'t have a technical background,\nI think you\'ll find it highly entertaining.</p>\n<p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/11/19/debugging-stories-with-haseeb-qureshi/">Debugging Stories with Haseeb Qureshi</a></p>',frontmatter:{path:"/on-debugging",title:"On Debugging",date:"03-31-2017",tag:"Tech"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
