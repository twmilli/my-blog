Writing hijacks your mindset to make you more positive. Regardless of how bad of a day you're having, it's hard to be negative in your writing.

I'm not a great writer. In fact, as a kid I hated writing because I was so bad, but that's okay.  Even if no one ever reads what you write, you can start bringing positivity into the world and your life today.</p>",frontmatter:{path:"/side-effects-of-writing",title:"The Side Effects of Writing",date:"07-26-2017",tag:"Writing"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
