And I'm okay with that.</p>\\n<p>This week for the first time in awhile, I started to feel a little run down.  I stay pretty busy here.  My mindset for the summer has pretty much been, \\\"I'll sleep in September\\\".  But this week for whatever reason, I started to feel the effects of always doing.  Sometimes the best cure for this is to take it easy for a few days and just go to sleep early as I did this week.</p>\\n<p>But pushing from the other side of this, it's important to understand that if you're like me, you're never going to not be \\\"busy\\\".  This is a fact of life.  There will always be an effectively unlimited  list of things you need or want to do, and a limited time to do them.</p>\\n<p>If you find yourself telling yourself, \\\"I really want to do x, but I'm going to wait until y is finished before starting\\\", it's almost certainly a fallacy.</p>\\n<p>I could tell you the reasons I haven't made a podcast episode, but ultimately they're just excuses.  I could tell you I'm waiting until my internship finishes to devote more time to writing, but the truth is I'll be just as busy (if not more) with other things as soon as school starts.</p>\\n<p>If you're feeling overwhelmed or run down, sometimes you need to take a step back and give yourself a break.</p>\\n<p>Other times, maybe you just need to embrace it.  Being busy is too easy of an excuse not to do something you genuinely want to do.  There will probably never be a perfect time to start a blog, or a side business, or learn to code.</p>\\n<p>So why wait?  You can start today.</p>\\n<h2>Unconventional Career Advice</h2>\\n<p>Working my first real 9-5 job this summer has forced me to think about my career and what I want to do next year.  I've been thinking about it a lot.  Naturally, I talk to other people about it as well.</p>\\n<p>Recently someone said something that really resonated with me:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>\\\"Whether public company or startup doesn't really matter, how much they pay doesn't really matter, almost nothing matters but how well your first job is going to set you up for the future\\\".</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Salary, perks, prestige of company, etc. are all distractions.  As long as you continue to grow and learn, any money that you make now will be dwarfed by what you will make later in your career.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>\\\"Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.\\\" - Bill Gates</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>To my fellow seniors thinking about working in tech, I think it's worth questioning if Google and Facebook should really be considered the most desirable companies to work at.</p>\\n<p>Ask yourself why you want to work there.  If it's mostly about salaries and prestige, that's okay, but understand that by choosing to work there, you might be getting these things in the short term only to give them up in the long term.</p>\\n<p>I'm not saying these are bad places to work, but I do think there is a real danger of working for a big company, not being able to move fast, and as a result not learning as fast as you could in some of the prime years of your life.</p>\\n<p>How do you think about where you want to work?  I'm always open to conflicting opinions and I'd love to here your thoughts.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>Although I did spend a lot of time sleeping this week, I still fit in a little fun as well.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 464px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 178.01724137931035%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"fireworks\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/fireworks1-686b59b8bef83d4c423beabb30a87e17-60652.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/fireworks1-686b59b8bef83d4c423beabb30a87e17-de4e7.png 200w,\\n/static/fireworks1-686b59b8bef83d4c423beabb30a87e17-dcdc2.png 400w,\\n/static/fireworks1-686b59b8bef83d4c423beabb30a87e17-60652.png 464w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>Fireworks on Ocean Beach</h4>\\n<p>Yesterday I took my first dip in the Pacific ocean of the summer yesterday at ocean beach.

This leads to what the founder likes to refer to as \\\"dirty sock\\\" flavor. The more you know.</p>\\n<p>From there, he sat us down for a presentation on the history of coffee, Saint Frank's, and most importantly, the coffee producers with which he works directly.</p>\\n<p>If you're a big coffee drinker, it's fascinating to learn how complex the process is that takes a green coffee bean to the cup of coffee that you consume every day.</p>\\n<p>Saint Frank's works closely with Farmer's in Honduras, Guatemala, and places around the globe to improve their livelihood, and make fantastic coffee in the process.</p>\\n<p>By the end of the presentation, I could feel his passion running through me.  There were a few times where I legitimately\\nthought that he might come to tears talking about the farmers he works with, and the impact that he has made on their lives.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“I want people to drink less coffee, but better coffee.  Less coffee, but more expensive coffee.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>He had me sold.  Our purchasing power matters, and the more we treat coffee as a commodity, the more we hurt the livelihood of the people making it.  Sure coffee is kind of a commodity, but if you've tasted a variety of well crafted coffee, you know that coffee's from different places can taste radically different.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"latte art\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-300e3.jpg 1200w,\\n/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\\n/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-3a622.jpg 2400w,\\n/static/latte-7ff667fc8ec65ec29b37d260e8a91d09-c1f12.jpg 3120w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>Turns out the owner also makes some pretty decent lattes</h4>\\n<p>If at this point you're thinking that this is just another pretentious SF coffee shop charging $5 for a coffee, I get it,\\nbut I have to disagree.</p>\\n<p>When I finally tasted the four coffees that had been prepared for the tour, I got it.  By no means do I have a refined coffee palette, but each coffee was packed with flavors nowhere to be found in a cup of Dunkin or Starbucks.</p>\\n<p>It's a good reminder to us all of the power of doing one thing, and one thing extraordinarily well.</p>\\n<p>You won't find a long list of fancy drinks or baked goods at the roastery.  The focus is on the coffee.  There are\\ndozens of shops in SF that they are competing with, but Saint Frank's has earned a reputation by having a ruthless focus on a simple goal: producing the best cup of coffee they possibly can.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/therealinternsf/\\\">The Real Intern</a> for making this event happen.</p>\\n<p>Since then, my roommate Tyler and I have been brainstorming ideas for how we can encourage others to discover the deliciousness of high-end coffees, and to share them with others.</p>\\n<p>A few of our early ideas include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://untappd.com/\\\">Untapped</a> but for coffee</li>\\n<li>A beautiful way to search coffee's by a number of categories including notes.

Afterwards I couldn't resist going to <a href=\\\"http://www.azucarsf.com/\\\">Azucar Lounge</a>\\nwith a few of my roommates for five dollar margaritas.  It's safe to say we celebrated Taco Tuesday in full force.</p>\\n<h2>What I Wish I Know @20</h2>\\n<p>Braintree held a fun panel Q &#x26; A event on Wednesday about career tips and life advice for interns all over the Bay Area.</p>\\n<p>It was a fun chance to talk with fellow interns at google, twitter, stripe and other tech companies about what they're working on.  Like most advice, it was nothing earth-shattering, but it was fun to hear a diversity of perspectives.</p>\\n<h2>Luck</h2>\\n<p>During the event, an intern asked \\\"I feel like I could attribute all of my successes in my short career to luck, how do you think about luck?\\\"</p>\\n<p>I wasn't asked the question, but it got me thinking about my answer.  The odds of any of us becoming humans, being born in the U.S, and somehow ending up in San Francisco during one of the most exciting time periods ever (in my person opinion) are ridiculous.</p>\\n<p>It's this incredible combination of things that I hope I can always stay thankful for.</p>\\n<p>But that being said, I'm not sure it's ever helpful for us to believe that our life is ruled by luck.  Even if there is no way to know, it seems better to assume that we as individuals are control of our future, so that we will act in the most beneficial way (ideally for ourselves and for society) as we possibly can.</p>\\n<p>You are not a lottery ticket.</p>\\n<p>Luck undoubtedly plays a massive role in our lives, but what matters it was we do with it.  One of my favorite podcast episodes, which I recently re-listened to, talks about this philosophy.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Exploring Buena Vista Park\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/buenavista-f8cb11933124d1bbb0cdfa02622a53c2-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/buenavista-f8cb11933124d1bbb0cdfa02622a53c2-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/buenavista-f8cb11933124d1bbb0cdfa02622a53c2-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/buenavista-f8cb11933124d1bbb0cdfa02622a53c2-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/buenavista-f8cb11933124d1bbb0cdfa02622a53c2-300e3.jpg 1200w,\\n/static/buenavista-f8cb11933124d1bbb0cdfa02622a53c2-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\\n/static/buenavista-f8cb11933124d1bbb0cdfa02622a53c2-e49fc.jpg 1944w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>Exploring Buena Vista</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/02/12/10-philosophies-for-developers/\\\">SEDaily - Ten philosophies for developers</a></p>\\n<p>Software engineer or not, I think it's worth the listen.</p>\\n<h2>Lassen National Park</h2>\\n<p>My parents arrived Thursday night and promptly took me out to Roti (thanks Alix for the recommendation.

A fresh, young, excited perspective that an intern brings will always be valuable.</p>\\n<p>Sure, the development time for my project has certainly taken longer than if two full-time employees were working on it, but we're still making steady progress and I'm confident we'll be close to completion by the end of my internship.</p>\\n<p>On top of that, even working as a software engineer, writing code is only of of the many ways you can provide value.  Want to write a blog post for the marketing team?  Go for it.  See a place where documentation could be improved?  Fix it yourself.  There are so many ways to add value, where you don't need years of experience to help the company.</p>\\n<p>Last week, the interns also got to sit down with Juan Benitez, GM at Braintree.</p>\\n<p>My favorite quote from the session was \\\"Legacy code means you're doing something right\\\".</p>\\n<p>Simple, but I love it.  The Disputes team has only been around for ~2.5 years so I'm lucky enough to not work with much legacy code, but for those working on Braintree's monolith, working with legacy code is a fact of daily life.</p>\\n<p>At least for me, I love always working with the latest and hottest new technologies, but that's not always what's best for building a business.</p>\\n<p>Having clean code is important, but at the end of the day your customers don't care what language you use or what the code looks like.</p>\\n<p>This seems obvious, but it's easy to forget when you're buried in the details for the better part of each day.</p>\\n<h2>Interviews</h2>\\n<p>It's hard to believe, but recruiting for full-time positions starting summer 2018 has already begun.</p>\\n<p>As far as prepping goes, I've actually been fairly disciplined, all things considered.  My biggest areas of focus going forward are dynamic programming, searching and sorting, with a little graph theory on the side.</p>\\n<p>I won't bore you with the details, but maybe if I actually end up doing well on interviews I can write up a more detailed post on what I have been doing at some point.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"sunset\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-300e3.jpg 1200w,\\n/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\\n/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-3a622.jpg 2400w,\\n/static/sunset-f8a11d5cf8fe77c47b0fba302594e23c-646e8.jpg 4160w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p>Thanks for taking the time out of your day to read.

We promptly packed ourselves, along with a few days worth of food into a rented 15 person van.</p>\\n<p>The drive down took us about 5 hours due to holiday traffic and a stop at In-N-Out.

I don't go to most of them, but there's something intriguing about meeting up with a bunch of strangers brought together by a common interest.</p>\\n<p>I talked to loads of people there, most notably some current students at <a href=\\\"http://www.hackreactor.com/?utm_source=googlesearchnetwork&#x26;utm_medium=text&#x26;utm_campaign=P_Search_BrandOnsite_General&#x26;utm_term=hack%20reactor&#x26;utm_content=HROS\\\">Hack Reactor</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.appacademy.io/\\\">App Academy</a>, two of the most selective coding boot camps in San Francisco.</p>\\n<p>I've heard a lot of mixed opinions about coding bootcamps, so it was satisfying to be able to hear directly from people that have gone through the experience.</p>\\n<p>I'm super interested in alternative methods of education and the edtech industry.  It's absolutely an area that I think needs and will continue to grow in the coming years.</p>\\n<p>The diversity amongst the bootcamp students that I met was also fascinating.</p>\\n<p>There was a 19 year-old that had lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle after graduating high school.  He visited almost every state in the U.S, and paid for it mainly through street piano performances.</p>\\n<p>At some point he figured out that he could hack together websites as freelance work to generate a little extra income on the side.  He ended up getting super into it, coming to San Francisco, and getting accepted to Hack Reactor.</p>\\n<p>I met a guy in his mid 30s that had a PhD in neurobiology.  He told me he wanted to learn to code so that he could pursue his dream of working on Elon Musk's Neuralink.</p>\\n<p>People of all types are learning to code for all kinds of reasons.</p>\\n<p>If it's something you have an interest in, you don't have to drop everything and enroll in a bootcamp.  A few hours a week is a great place to start.  Every day is a great place to start.</p>\\n<p>If you're not sure where to start, or you're feeling stuck in your journey, feel free to reach out to me (twm013@bucknell.edu).</p>\\n<h2>Internapalooza</h2>\\n<p>Wednesday night was internapalooza.</p>\\n<p>For the most part, the event was a good reminder of the fact that networking events, especially those made up of ~8,000 interns are not actually a great place to \\\"network\\\".</p>\\n<p>That being said, the event was still a good opportunity to chat with recruiters and engineers at top tech companies that don't come to recruit at Bucknell.</p>\\n<p>I also enjoyed the anecdote shared by <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Houston\\\">Drew Houston</a>, CEO of dropbox.</p>\\n<p>When he was in college living in a Fraternity house, they had a constant problem of people leaving dirty dishes in the sink.  One day after a meal, him and his friend went to wash their dishes (like any well-behaved frat bro should).</p>\\n<p>Without saying anything, his friend picked up a few dirty dishes, washed them, and continued on.</p>\\n<p>\\\"You don't have to wash those\\\" he told his friend.  It wasn't fair that he should wash someone else's dishes because they had left them in the sink out of negligence.</p>\\n<p>Later, he thought back on the moment and realized maybe he had been thinking about it wrong.  Since then, \\\"washing the dishes\\\" has become a guiding principal for various facets of his life.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is to take a little extra time, and do it yourself.  </p>\\n<p>In terms of work, I love this mantra.  If you see a reoccurring problem, you don't need to figure out who is responsible for it, or ask permission, you just need to care enough to solve it.  That in and of itself is valuable.</p>\\n<p>The world could get a lot better if we all picked up a few extra dirty dishes.</p>\\n<p>On Thursday, I did my first escape room as part of a Braintree intern event.</p>\\n<p>It's pretty insane the experience that the owners of <a href=\\\"https://www.tryreason.com/\\\">Reason</a> have been able to create.  I would definitely recommend checking if out if you're with a big group and appreciate puzzles and cool technologies.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"row post-image-bg\\\" markdown=\\\"0\\\">\\n    <video width=\\\"99%\\\" height=\\\"540\\\" autoplay loop muted markdown=\\\"0\\\">\\n        <source src=\\\"/reason_video-9d77598dfc457b28b6101a3f74c01515.mp4\\\" type=\\\"video/mp4\\\" markdown=\\\"0\\\" >\\n    </video>\\n</div>\\n<h4>Post Escape Room Victory Dance</h4>\\n<p>We solved it, but admittedly about a minute or two over the 80 minute time limit.</p>\\n<p>On Friday I grabbed dinner at <a href=\\\"http://spinnerie.com/\\\">Spinnerie</a> with Jeff Meyerson, host of <a href=\\\"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/\\\">Software Engineering Daily</a>, my favorite podcast for keeping up with software and technology.</p>\\n<p>It was a little awkward at first, but before I knew it we were engrossed in conversations about education, cryptocurrency, advertising, the future of podcasts, and so much more.</p>\\n<p>It was pretty cool getting to meet the person who has produced literally hundreds of hours of content that helped me get the internship at Braintree and to where I am today.</p>\\n<p>Thanks Jeff, for continuing to put out a plethora of great content.</p>\\n<p>Pride parade was also on Sunday which was quite the experience.  I walked with PayPal/Braintree/Venmo and then walked to Dolores park with a few of my fellow interns (shoutout to Maggie and Sasha).</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"rainbow flags\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/rainbow-8e14cdc45fb110c6a34081584a57398e-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/rainbow-8e14cdc45fb110c6a34081584a57398e-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/rainbow-8e14cdc45fb110c6a34081584a57398e-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/rainbow-8e14cdc45fb110c6a34081584a57398e-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/rainbow-8e14cdc45fb110c6a34081584a57398e-300e3.jpg 1200w,\\n/static/rainbow-8e14cdc45fb110c6a34081584a57398e-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\\n/static/rainbow-8e14cdc45fb110c6a34081584a57398e-3a622.jpg 2400w,\\n/static/rainbow-8e14cdc45fb110c6a34081584a57398e-c1f12.jpg 3120w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p>We hit up bi-rite creamery again (which was equally amazing as the first time), and hung out at the park for a bit.</p>\\n<p>The fact that a scene like Dolores park even exists is hard to believe until you see it for yourself.

It's easier to let my pair take the lead on everything, but I know the only way to get closer to his level is to take the lead on certain tasks and get comfortable working independently at times.</p>\\n<p>It's helpful to remember that most of the time my pair has just as little background knowledge in whatever problem we're working on as I do, he's just gotten really good at teaching himself how to quickly figure it out.</p>\\n<p>In terms of development skills, I still lack a lot of general rails knowledge, but I have gotten a lot more comfortable working in Ruby, in part by spending a little extra time outside of work reading articles and watching some interesting conference talks.</p>\\n<p>Here's a few of my favorites:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piLmdh3Am3o\\\">Lies, Damned Lies, and Substrings by Haseeb Qureshi</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piLmdh3Am3o\\\">My Meta Moments by John Dewyze</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_MpGRfnY5s\\\">Perusing the Rails Source Code - A Beginners Guide by Alex Kitchens</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I've also been thinking a lot about company culture recently, something that first-time founders often completely overlook.  If you look at all of the top tech companies: Netflix, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc..., they all have a unique but very intentional culture.</p>\\n<p>Braintree is no different.</p>\\n<p>It's hard to convey exactly what the culture is here, but there is definitely a lot of value placed on open communication feedback, and openness.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"cable car\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/cablecar-e5235a95b698fb734e875753949214ed-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/cablecar-e5235a95b698fb734e875753949214ed-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/cablecar-e5235a95b698fb734e875753949214ed-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/cablecar-e5235a95b698fb734e875753949214ed-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/cablecar-e5235a95b698fb734e875753949214ed-300e3.jpg 1200w,\\n/static/cablecar-e5235a95b698fb734e875753949214ed-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\\n/static/cablecar-e5235a95b698fb734e875753949214ed-3a622.jpg 2400w,\\n/static/cablecar-e5235a95b698fb734e875753949214ed-646e8.jpg 4160w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p>Braintree also hires a lot of developers that did not formally study computer science in college and were largely self taught to begin their career.

SF seemed like an exciting place to live for 10 weeks, but probably not somewhere that I would want to live.</p>\\n<p>Now, well, I still have no idea where I want to live after I graduate, but I can safely say the San Francisco has earned it's way into the mix.</p>\\n<p>Here's the highlights of the past week or so.</p>\\n<h2>Co-Living is awesome</h2>\\n<p>Whenever I bring a friend over to my apartment, they are so quick to judge.</p>\\n<p>\\\"How can you possibly live with so many other people in such a small area?\\\"</p>\\n<p>At best, they see it as a reasonable sacrifice that I make in order to save money.  I get it, sharing a room with a bunch of other young interns sounds kind of crazy (it is), but the benefits extend far beyond saving a little extra cash.</p>\\n<p>I'll be honest, I really had no idea what I was getting myself into in terms of housing before I came here.

On one hand, it's great for productivity, but we all need a little spontaneity in our lives.</p>\\n<p>Most days I get up, go to the gym, bike to work and spend the day coding and learning from cool people.

If you're like me, you've heard people talk about bitcoin, ethereum, \\\"the block chain\\\", \\\"social contracts\\\", \\\"mining\\\", etc, and had no idea what they were talking about.  People have been talking about bitcoin as the future for awhile now, yet the vast majority of people (even most of the people investing) have little or no idea of what exactly bitcoin is, how it works, and why it is potentially useful.  This podcast is a fantastic introduction to anyone trying to get a better understanding of cryptocurrency.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://medium.com/the-wtf-economy/do-more-what-amazon-teaches-us-about-ai-and-the-jobless-future-8051b19a66a\\\">Do More! What Amazon Teaches Us About AI and the “Jobless Future”</a><br>\\nThe core argument of this article is that the best applications of technology actually create jobs by allowing us to do more.  Growth in employees at amazon continues to skyrocket even with additional use of robots and A.I.  I love the optimism, especially in an area where experts are quick to predict the worst. But, there are also plenty of counterexamples to Tim's argument as well.

Source: <a href=\\\"https://assets.themuse.com/uploaded/companies/295/office/414/f1.jpg?v=None\\\">The Muse</a></h4>\\n<p>My notebook is already cluttered with various keyboard commands for vim, tmux, as well as Mac OSX as a whole.</p>\\n<p>All development here is done within tmux/vim using a setup we call <a href=\\\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/vimux-simple-vim-and-tmux-integration/\\\">vimux</a>. You have to get up to speed fast.</p>\\n<p>I still have a long way to go, but here's what I've been doing to get proficient at navigating vim as quickly as possible.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Go through <a href=\\\"http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/vimtutor1.html\\\">vimtutor</a> every day. The first time through might take you awhile but after each iteration you get a little faster.  I've been doing this and it's probably the thing that's helped me the most.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Whenever you have a few minutes to kill, pop open a window in vim.  Practice navigating around to drill shortcuts into your head.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Ask.  During pairing sessions, anytime my partner did something super useful that I didn't know how to do, I would ask what shortcut he used, and then jot it down in a notebook. Practice using these whenever you get the chance.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Transition to using only vim, even for projects outside of work.  After a few days of vimtutor, you'll probably reach the level where you can do all of your development with vim.  You might be a little slow at first, but that's okay.  I recently made this switch myself, and I can already tell it will pay dividends.  Plus, there's something so satisfying about correctly using a cool keyboard shortcut.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>You are enough.</h2>\\n<p>I won't lie, the first few days of the internship were stressful.</p>\\n<p>I was jumping into a new work environment, working with technologies I've never touched, on a scale that none of my projects have come remotely close to.</p>\\n<p>By the end of my first two days, I was finding it tough to not get down on myself.</p>\\n<p>What can I possibly offer to Braintree when I am surrounded by people that know so much more than me?  What if I'm not good enough?  How will I ever reach the level of everyone around me?</p>\\n<p>If you've ever felt this way in any facet of your life, I think it's helpful to take a step back.</p>\\n<p>Regardless of who you are or what you're doing, you have something unique to offer.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 105.86538461538461%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"coffee\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-300e3.jpg 1200w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-3a622.jpg 2400w,\\n/static/sightglass-c40b2634e0f0131d30d930b434a57eb2-c1f12.jpg 3120w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"https://sightglasscoffee.com/\\\">Sightglass Coffee</a></h4>\\n<p>Rather than focusing on how far I have to go, I try to focus on what I can do every day to get a little bit better.</p>\\n<p>So what can I contribute to Braintree?</p>\\n<p>I'm still not sure, but I do know that I can bring energy, excitement, and a hunger to learn every day.</p>\\n<p>Exercise and meditation have also been extremely helpful for helping me get over the feeling of being overwhelmed.

This week I got my personal computer setup for RoR development and started working through <a href=\\\"https://www.railstutorial.org/\\\">this</a> book.</p>\\n<p>So far I'm really enjoying the change of pace from the full-stack javascript world.</p>\\n<p>Rails gets you up and running super quickly, and it's interesting to look at the differences from the node/express approach I'm used to.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"food\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-300e3.jpg 1200w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-c15ef.jpg 1600w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-3a622.jpg 2400w,\\n/static/food-078c7d06595a28b75ffc7e7909d0c7b6-c1f12.jpg 3120w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>Sometimes I cook things</h4>\\n<h3>Here's a few miscellaneous resources that I've found helpful to learn about some of the other technologies I'll be using this summer:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-containers-vms-and-docker-79a9e3e119b\\\">A Beginner-Friendly Introduction to Containers, VMs and Docker</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/tag/kafka/\\\">Apache Kafka</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://vim.rtorr.com/\\\">More Vim</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Open Dev Day</h3>\\n<p>Every other Friday at Braintree is <a href=\\\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/walking-the-talk-open-dev-time-at-braintree/\\\">Open Dev Day</a>.  Essentially that means that you get to spend the day exploring whatever you want and building something cool.  The first one of my internship is this Friday.</p>\\n<p>I'm still thinking out ideas.  If you have any thoughts about something you think would be cool/fun to build, let me know.</p>\\n<h2>Podcast</h2>\\n<p>I'm still working towards making this happen.  I reached out to another potential guest this weekend and I'm continuing to work on questions for my outline.</p>\\n<p>The more I learn about voice and Alexa as a technology, the more I see it as a huge opportunity.  Gary Vaynerchuck recently published an article about [The Rise of Audio &#x26; Voice](The Rise of Audio &#x26; Voice).  If you have some extra time, it's worth the read.</p>\\n<p>Amazon is doing a huge <a href=\\\"https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-developer-skill-promotion\\\">promotion</a> for the month of June to give an echo dot to anyone who publishes an Alexa skill.  Whether you are a developer or not, I highly reccommend taking an hour to work through one of the <a href=\\\"https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-skills-developer-training\\\">tutorials</a>, both for a free dot, and to get a better understand of the voice ecosystem.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>That's all for this week folks.

I'm still scouting out quality butchers nearby but I'm pretty excited about it...hopefully my roommates won't mind.</p>\\n<h2>Podcast</h2>\\n<p>Those who know me know that I love podcasts, and naturally I've always wanted to try recording my own.  Recently, one of my favorite podcasts, <a href=\\\"http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/\\\">Software Engineering Daily</a> opened up to allow others to work with the owner to host an episode.</p>\\n<p>I'm still fleshing out a lot of the details but I'm currently working towards recording an episode about Alexa Skill Development.  There's a lot more work that needs to go into this but expect to hear more in the future...unless of course work gets a little too crazy.</p>\\n<h2>Interview Prep</h2>\\n<p>This is the point where you might start to think I'm a little crazy (you're not wrong).  If you're not interested in Software Engineering, feel free to skip this part.</p>\\n<p>I'm planning to spend ~5 hours a week preparing for technical interviews so that I'm not cramming come the fall.

Note that the url for my API has been stubbed for the time being out of respect for Smitten Kitchen.</p>\\n<h2>React Native isn’t going away any time soon</h2>\\n<p>A common reservation among developers is that they don’t want to invest the time to learn a new technology if there’s a strong chance it will become obsolete in the near future.</p>\\n<p>Even from my relatively minimal experience with React Native, I’ve found it to be an enormously powerful tool. I am confident it will be used in the years to come.</p>\\n<p>Facebook, Instagram, and Airbnb all built the latest versions of their mobile apps using React Native. And here’s a <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/showcase.html\\\">list</a> of the some other popular apps that were built using it.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@jeffmeyerson\\\">Jeff Meyerson</a>, creator of the podcast <a href=\\\"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/04/11/the-future-of-react-native-with-brent-vatne-and-adam-perry/\\\">Software Engineering Daily</a>, has talked extensively about the React Native platform. He believes it will survive and continue to capture the majority of the mobile ecosystem.</p>\\n<p>He has even speculated that Facebook may be creating their own mobile phone, which would be built specifically to support apps made with React Native.</p>\\n<h2>How React Native is different from other cross-platform tools</h2>\\n<p>If you’re new to <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/next/\\\">React Native</a>, it’s an open source project started by Facebook. It allows developers to build cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript. It works very similarly to React, Facebook’s popular JavaScript library for building single page web applications.</p>\\n<p>I’ve always been skeptical of tools that advertise themselves as cross-platform for mobile. All too often you end up with a look, feel, and performance that doesn’t quite match the native platform.</p>\\n<p>React Native is not like other mobile app development frameworks, such as Ionic or Cordova. Those run inside of a web view, or an “HTML5 app,” or a “hybrid app.”</p>\\n<p>You build a high performance mobile app that is indistinguishable from one that is built using Swift/Objective-C or Java.</p>\\n<p>That being said, it is still important to understand the intricacies and differences between platforms. The user experience for Android and iOS are fundamentally different, and you still need to build your app in a way that will feel natural on both platforms.</p>\\n<p>In addition, if there is ever a feature that you need to add that is not yet supported by the React Native library, React Native makes it easy to write your own <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios.html\\\">Native Module</a> in the corresponding language, which can then be linked to your React Native codebase.</p>\\n<h2>How To Get Started</h2>\\n<p>Personally, I used <a href=\\\"https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/\\\">this Udemy course</a> to get started. It served as a nice refresher of react and redux, and was helpful for getting setup.</p>\\n<p>And recently Facebook released <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/introducing-create-react-native-app.html\\\">Create React Native App</a>. This tool further simplifies the initial setup process.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 55.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"alt text\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/udemy-4dc03aedd9da09db1b5ea990760ce7ea-ea913.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/udemy-4dc03aedd9da09db1b5ea990760ce7ea-086ab.png 200w,\\n/static/udemy-4dc03aedd9da09db1b5ea990760ce7ea-b16c6.png 400w,\\n/static/udemy-4dc03aedd9da09db1b5ea990760ce7ea-ea913.png 800w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>Working my way through the Udemy Course</h4>\\n<p>If you’re already familiar with React, you can probably dive straight into the <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html\\\">documentation</a>. For only $10 however, the course is a bargain and walks you through the process of making four mobile apps as well as common components that you can reuse in future projects.</p>\\n<p>Udemy also offers a course covering <a href=\\\"https://www.udemy.com/react-native-advanced/\\\">Advanced React Native Concepts</a>, for those already familiar with the platform.</p>\\n<h2>Styling in React Native</h2>\\n<p>Styling in React Native takes some getting used to. React Native heavily uses CSS flexbox, something that I was not particularly comfortable with, even coming from a web background.</p>\\n<p>Luckily there are already some fantastic resources to learn about flexbox:</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/an-animated-guide-to-flexbox-d280cf6afc35\\\">How flexbox works — explained with big, colorful, animated gifs</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://browniefed.com/blog/react-native-layout-examples/\\\">React Native Layout Examples</a></p>\\n<p>A fun game to help you practice: <a href=\\\"http://flexboxfroggy.com/\\\">Flexbox Froggy</a></p>\\n<p>After working with React Native for a few weeks, I now have a much better understanding of flexbox, which I can apply to my next web project.</p>\\n<p>The current best practice is to create a styles object for each component, then apply it via inline-styles. Keep in mind that you are not actually writing CSS, so the naming of properties is a little different as well.</p>\\n<p>Another key difference is that you cannot use HTML tags in your javascript, because you are writing code to run on a phone, rather than in a browser. Instead, components are built with a set of base level components provided by the React Native library.</p>\\n<p>It takes a little getting used to, but before you know it you’ll find yourself accidentally using a View tag in place of a <div></div> in your next web app.</p>\\n<p>To get a better feel for how all of this works, take a peek at the code for a simple button component below.</p>\\n<script src=\\\"https://gist.github.com/twmilli/5d2bace1faa1d04b1d4b5217c553a671.js\\\"></script>\\n<p>Here’s the <a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/twmilli/5d2bace1faa1d04b1d4b5217c553a671#file-button-js\\\">GitHub gist</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\\n<p>Navigation is one of the few areas of React Native where there is not a consensus on a clear solution.</p>\\n<p>React Router has become the standard library of choice for the React community, but there are a number of libraries floating around in the React Native community.</p>\\n<p>Personally I used the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux\\\">React Native Router Flux</a> library for my project which worked just fine. But I can see how you might run into some bigger issues on more complex projects.</p>\\n<p>Luckily, React Native has already developed a massive community. New versions of the project are released every month, so I am confident that issues like navigation will be solved over time.</p>\\n<h2>Developer Experience Matters</h2>\\n<p>The ability to share code between Android and iOS applications is undoubtedly a draw of React Native, but it is only a small part of what makes the tool so incredible.</p>\\n<p>My favorite part of using React Native is the ability to reload immediately. I have used Android Studio in the past, and commonly had to deal with 30–60 second build times.</p>\\n<p>This saves time and I found it easier to get into a <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29\\\">flow state</a> without those pesky build times to disrupt me.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/hot-reload-5b71ef78637d1f6b32fe0f685b274612.gif\\\" alt=\\\"alt text\\\"></p>\\n<h4>Hi I’m Taylor. Hot Reloading changed my life. Source: Facebook</h4>\\n<p>React Native makes mobile development fun again, and that alone is enough of a reason to try it out for your next project.</p>\\n<h2>Be Willing To Explore</h2>\\n<p>React Native is a perfect example of what can happen when we apply ideas that have proven successful in one area of software (web), to a seemingly separate area (mobile).</p>\\n<p>As <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@hosseeb\\\">Haseeb Quereshi</a> convincingly argued in his <a href=\\\"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/02/24/convergence-with-haseeb-qureshi/\\\">talk on convergence</a>, as software engineers we should be converging on certain principles, languages and tools that can be successfully applied universally.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative;

His goal is to get readers excited about investing, and the opportunities available.  If you're focused on all of the problems that might arise, chances are you'll never start.</p>\\n<p>Tim Ferriss makes starting a business and quitting your job to travel the world sound easy.

All of the speakers were fantastic, but my favorite talk was by Nicholas Gilson, titled \\\"failing to learn\\\".</p>\\n<p>Nick is the Founder and CEO of Gilson Boards, a ski a snowboard manufacturer located in Winfield, PA.  He taught middle school science in Nashville, TN as part of Teach for America before going on to launch his company.</p>\\n<p>His talk was incredibly insightful and inspirational, and I wanted to share my key takeaways.</p>\\n<h3>1. A creative mindset often trumps knowledge.</h3>\\n<p>You don't need to know everything. You just need the confidence in yourself that you can figure it out along the way.</p>\\n<p>While Nick was teaching for a failing school in Nashville Tennessee, he made the decision\\nto not \\\"teach to the test\\\".</p>\\n<p>Instead of putting his focus on teaching kids the information he knew would be on\\nthe standardized test that would be used to measure his success, he focused on giving them\\na skill-set and mindset they could use to figure out the answers even if they didn't know\\nthe material.  He realized that if he could teach these kids concepts that would be valuable in real life, any multiple choice question a standardized test could ask would be easy in comparison.</p>\\n<p>Over the time Nick was there, the school went from being unranked, to 4th in the district.</p>\\n<p>When Nick started building his first Snowboard prototypes, he had no idea what he was getting into.\\nHe described the experience of riding one of his early designs\\nas \\\"riding down the mountain on a canoe\\\".  This failure would eventually lead to the creation of\\nwhat Gilson has named the \\\"soft age\\\", one of the major features that differentiates Gilson from any other\\nsnowboard company.</p>\\n<h3>2. Every failure is an opportunity</h3>\\n<p>When Nick arrived at the middle school in Nashville, he saw that the school was failing the kids everyday.  In his 6th grade class, reading levels ranged from 3rd grade to 12th grade.  More and more emphasis was being placed on standardized tests, which focused on facts and formulas that could easily be looked up on the internet.</p>\\n<p>The kids were being trained as factory workers in an age where we need more innovators.</p>\\n<p>These clear failures gave Nick the chance to try something different.  He created an environment where all of the kids were on the same team, where they could utilize there own strengths to help others.  He built his own lesson plans to help kids learn in new ways.</p>\\n<p>Again in his business, many of Nick's failures have led to new discoveries.</p>\\n<p>Nick spent most of a school year designing and building his first prototypes. During his spring break he went to Colorado to test it, expecting it to work great.</p>\\n<p>It failed.</p>\\n<p>When he returned to his classroom in Nashville, he presented all of the data he had collected, and explained to the kids that his project had been a complete failure. I had fun he told them, but I think it's time for me to move on to something new.</p>\\n<p>One of the kids in his class raised his hand and said \\\"If you can quit, then we can too\\\".</p>\\n<p>So Nick realized he had no choice but to keep at it. He took another look at all of the problems with his design and iterated to find ways to solve them. A few years later his class told him it was time to quit his job as a teacher in order to pursue his dream full time.</p>\\n<p>Fast forward a few years and Nick hit a wall again. Gilson Boards contacted over 8000 retailers and was rejected from every single one of them.  Instead of giving up, they found a way to find\\ntheir own customers and cost effectively ship direct to consumer.  This allows them to maintain\\na healthy margin, despite being 100% American made and sourcing higher quality materials than\\ntheir competitors.</p>\\n<h3>3. It takes tons and tons of work---and you might still fail</h3>\\n<p>While Nick was working at a school, he said spent roughly 100 hours a week in school and creating lesson plans, while spending what little free time he did have building his first snowboards.</p>\\n<p>He spent a year working at a cabin in rural Pennsylvania with no electricity or running water building the first 30 snowboards, so that he could invest as much money as possible into the materials and machinery to make the boards.</p>\\n<p>In hindsight, it's easy to justify all the work that went into creating Gilson, now the fastest growing snowboard company in the world.  At the time however, Nick had to know there was a very real chance he would fail---and fail in a way that meant his company was out of business.</p>\\n<p>Despite the fact that Gilson has now become a success story, the majority of new businesses still fail.  You have to be willing to put in the work despite knowing that the odds are against you.  Nick started a business because he couldn't help but try out his ideas in his spare time.</p>\\n<p>This kind of insane work ethic is only possible if you really love what you do.</p>\\n<p>The odds of changing the world are against us everyday.  It's on us to find something we love enough to overcome them.</p>\\n<p>eky\\nThanks for reading, and thank you Nick for giving a sick talk!</p>\\n<p>To find out more about his company, visit <a href=\\\"http://www.gilsonboards.com/\\\">gilsonboards.com</a></p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/nick-gilson-on-innocation\",\"title\":\"What Nick Gilson can teach us about failure and innovation\",\"date\":\"2017-4-09\",\"tag\":\"Business\"}}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/nick-gilson-on-innocation.json\n// module id = 661\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 75.1%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"alt text\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/goalbanner-43b7750c84965c98cd21e915b5be0f3c-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/goalbanner-43b7750c84965c98cd21e915b5be0f3c-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/goalbanner-43b7750c84965c98cd21e915b5be0f3c-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/goalbanner-43b7750c84965c98cd21e915b5be0f3c-631b1.jpg 800w,\\n/static/goalbanner-43b7750c84965c98cd21e915b5be0f3c-ab477.jpg 1000w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>Photo by <a href=\\\"https://unsplash.com/@aaronburden\\\">Aaron Burden</a></h4>\\n<p>Naturally, many people make goals focused on the final outcome they hope to achieve.\\nIf you are writing a book, you might make it a goal to get it published or sell X number\\nof copies.

Instead of just repeating what worked for me, try to take away just a few pieces that you can apply to your own life.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Advice is Autobiography” — James Altucher</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>What motivated you to pick up development?</h2>\\n<p>As a kid in high school I always dreamed of building an iPhone app, but I had no idea where to start. The world of programming seemed very overwhelming and I was busy with plenty of other things, so I kind of just forgot about it.</p>\\n<p>At Bucknell University (where I go to school), I study Chemical Engineering. I wasn’t quite sure what I wanted to study coming in as a freshmen, and only 10 weeks into my first semester I was forced to declare my major. Luckily, I randomly took an introductory programming class and became mildly interested in programming. Then I took another class in the Computer Science Department in the following semester. Around this point I became obsessed. It started out as just a genuine joy for programming, and then I slowly became fascinated with the tech industry as a whole and where technology is taking us.</p>\\n<p>My major is still Chemical Engineering but I have continued to supplement it with Computer Science classes along the way. Programming has now become a major hobby that I do during a lot of my free time outside of class.</p>\\n<h2>What in your opinion is the best way to learn development? What worked for you? Any resources you would like to recommend?</h2>\\n<p>I don’t think there is one “best” way. Everyone’s situation is different and there are tradeoffs to everything. That being said, I can share a few tips that I believe have helped me get to where I am now (I still have a lot to learn):</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>Have a ruthless focus: Choose one programming language and really commit to it. Once you commit, spend all of your time working in that language. Which language? It doesn’t matter too much and it depends on what you want to work on, but it’s hard to go wrong with JavaScript right now. Later on in your learning you can expand a little more and try different things out, but early on it’s really important to not get distracted.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Eliminate Distractions: This is related to the point above. While you’re coding, try to be 100% focused. Block email and distracting social media websites. Try using a website like YouTubeOnRepeat to play one song on repeat. All of these things can help you get into a flow state which will help make coding more enjoyable and allow you to accomplish more in a shorter period of time.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Map out your journey: FreeCodeCamp does this for you. I’ve heard great things about the Odin Project as well. If you don’t want to do web development, that’s fine. Instead just take the time to figure out what you don’t know. I guarantee you that there are amazingly helpful guides for it somewhere on the internet.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Follow your map: Set up a consistent schedule for yourself and do whatever it takes to follow it. If you are serious about getting better, try to write code every day (or at least 5 days a week). I have found having a really clear vision in my head for why I want to learn development helps sticking to this when you are tired, or want to relax, etc.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Build things: You have to constantly be building and applying everything you are learning in order to truly understand it. Theory is extremely important, but building something with this theory is absolutely essential.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Podcasts are also amazing for staying up to date with the industry. Software Engineering Daily is my favorite.</p>\\n<h2>How much time did your internship search take?</h2>\\n<p>I started applying at the end of August and I did not accept an offer until the end of October (~2 months). I applied to ~50 companies, got interviews with 8. I went to 2 onsites and got offers from both.</p>\\n<h2>Most of the people learning development are not sure when to start applying for a job. At which point in your journey you felt that it was the time to start applying?</h2>\\n<p>For me it was easier because I was applying for summer internships. I knew from my sophomore year that it’s extremely important to start applying early. Essentially I had a date in my mind when I knew I was going to start applying and I did everything I could in the 9 months before that to make myself a competitive applicant.</p>\\n<p>I think self-taught developers could benefit from this strategy as well. Choose a date 6 months, 1 year, 18 months (or however long you want) in advance by which time you will force yourself to start applying to jobs. You might find out that you’re not quite ready by that date, but you can continue learning more while applying to a few jobs everyday.</p>\\n<h2>Since many first timers don’t get past resume screening, what is something that you think helped you clear that stage?</h2>\\n<p>My tips:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>Get your resume checked and reviewed by other people that know what they’re talking about. /r/cscareerquestions/ is a great resource for this.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Build more sophisticated projects. It could be you just haven’t built a sufficient skill set yet. Get ‘so good they can’t ignore you’.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Apply to more companies. If you are actually good and just can’t get past the resume screening, all you need is a few interviews. Once you blow them out of the water and get an offer, you can use this as leverage to get interviews with more competitive companies.\\nCold email recruiters or reach out to them on LinkedIn. This is more effective after you’ve gotten at least one offer.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Network. Go to meetups, help other people, build your brand by writing on Medium or a personal blog. Don’t be afraid to tell people you are currently in the process of job searching, although don’t be obnoxious about it either. If you are providing value to people before you start looking for a job, they will naturally want to help you.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Sometimes job openings for junior developers list too many requirements. What is your advice to deal with such openings? Any tips on choosing the right companies to apply to?</h2>\\n<p>In general, don’t worry about the requirements listed on each application. Most companies really just want you to be able to write good, clean, readable code and solve hard problems. Especially for entry level positions, they don’t expect you to have every skill on the list. In general, you want to focus on a certain area during your learning process.</p>\\n<p>As far as choosing companies, I’d recommend applying to more places than you think you need to. I would personally start by applying to around 20 companies per week until you start getting interviews. After a few weeks you can adjust this number up or down depending on the number of interviews you are receiving.</p>\\n<p>For the majority of companies, just send your resume (no cover letter). In this industry, a lot of cover letters simply do not get read. During my job search I sent exactly 0 cover letters and I don’t believe that it negatively impacted my ability to get interviews. If you do have a few “dream” companies, it might be worth spending a little extra time to write a personalized cover letter just for those companies. If you are applying to mostly smaller companies, it’s probably worth crafting a few cover letters or reaching out to someone from the company on a more personal level.</p>\\n<h2>What are the common mistakes that you see juniors make when trying to get their first job? And how do you think they can improve their chances?</h2>\\n<p>Not getting good enough.</p>\\n<p>Sure, there is a lot of randomness in the interview process. Sometimes it’s hard to get an interview and sometimes you crush it and still get rejected. That being said, a lot of people have talked about this idea of “So good they can’t ignore you”. I truly believe that if you put in the work and get to a level where you can provide a lot of value to a company, you will land a job fairly quickly. Build a fantastic portfolio and grind through as many problems on CTCI (Cracking the Coding Interview) and LeetCode as you can and you will be prepared to crush every technical interview.</p>\\n<p>I realize this is controversial advice, especially in a field where imposter syndrome is very present. People have a tendency to think they are never good enough. That being said, I believe that people need to stop accepting that imposter syndrome is a natural thing that they will never get over. This might be true on some level, but having a good understanding of how your skills compare to others in the industry is extremely important. If you feel like you aren’t good enough, spend a little bit of time to figure out how your skills actually compare to those working in the industry and then evaluate. Maybe you just aren’t good enough yet.</p>\\n<p>Use the fact that you are trying to break into the tech industry as an advantage. Daymond John talks about this mindset in his book “The Power of Broke”. When I was trying to break in as an outsider, I knew I would have to be disproportionately better than everyone else just to get an interview. I was hungry for a job in tech. My disadvantage (not majoring in a directly related field) turned out to be a massive advantage because it motivated me to outwork everyone else applying for the same positions. How you can turn your disadvantages into an advantage? Put in the hours to hone your craft and I almost guarantee you will win.</p>\\n<h2>If you could go back in time, what is one thing that you would tell your younger self searching for his first developer job/internship?</h2>\\n<p>Enjoy the process. It’s cliche advice, but that’s because it’s true. Interviewing can be overwhelming, stressful, and exhausting. By the time you’re interviewing you’ve already put in the work. Try to relax, have fun and stay healthy. Don’t worry about landing the “perfect” job. It doesn’t exist. If you are trying to break into the industry, your first job is really just the beginning of your journey. Dan Abramov worked at companies most people have never heard of before going on to create Redux. Now he works at Facebook.</p>\\n<h2>Any books/people blogs that you followed that helped you greatly? Something that you think every developer should follow?</h2>\\n<p>Not all of these resources are directly programming related, but I do believe they were helpful in getting to where I am today.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Books: Give And Take by Adam Grant, Choose Yourself by James Altucher, Deep Work by Cal Newport, Tools of Titans by Tim Ferriss.</li>\\n<li>Podcasts: Software Engineering Daily, Scale Your Code, AskGaryVee Show, Tim Ferriss Show, The James Altucher Show, Developer Tea, CS75 Harvard Lectures.</li>\\n<li>Websites: FreeCodeCamp, Pramp, LeetCode, Haseebq</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Questions/feedback/suggestions?

The trick is, unless you are able to enjoy this process of slowly progressing over time, you will almost certainly never reach the level of skill that allows you to start being creative.</p>\\n<p>In many traditional CS programs, we have almost completely forgotten about this creative piece. Early on we have data structures and algorithms drilled into us, and practice with problems that have one clear answer.</p>\\n<p>These things are important, but I wish the teaching of these concepts could focus on open-ended projects, rather than grinding through problem sets. We tell ourselves that we learn faster if we remove creativity from the equation, but is it really true?</p>\\n<p>Many of the people in these classes are interested in computer science because they want to create. After a few of these classes, most of these same people have given up, or given up trying to use coding as their creative outlet.</p>\\n<p>When I look at the times when I was most burned out, it’s almost always because I forgot about the creative aspects of my projects.</p>\\n<p>Making another Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, [insert social network here] clone isn’t fun.

Photo by <a href=\\\"https://unsplash.com/@oscrse\\\">Oscar Nilsson</a></h4>\\n<p>Once again, building one of these clones as a project can be educational, but I caution you to make it the backbone of your learning.</p>\\n<p>If you can’t enjoy the process of learning to code along the way, you’ll probably get burned out. Even if you stick with it, by the time you reach where you want to go, you might not enjoy coding anymore.</p>\\n<p>For many of us, creativity (specifically through coding) has been slowly hammered out of us over time. It could be through our learning process, or what we do at work, but over time it becomes easy to forget about the joy that comes with creation.</p>\\n<p>The good news is, we can take back this creative spark at any time. It’s in our nature to be creative.</p>\\n<p>Anytime I’m feeling burnt out, I find that the answer is almost always to code more, but differently. If you’re feeling exhausted from your daily work doing a lot of debugging and maintenance work, start a side project.</p>\\n<p>Make something.</p>\\n<p>Make something stupid. Make something fun. Make something that makes you laugh. Make something you’ve always dreamed about.</p>\\n<p>It doesn’t matter, the point is to rediscover that feeling you had when you first made text appear on a website. Your creativity is important, and it’s important to take the time to foster it.</p>\\n<p>If you’re feeling stuck, check out these research backed <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@zjonsee/5-research-backed-steps-to-becoming-more-creative-4a87139d8fb8#.r5va015k7\\\">tips</a> to help you rediscover your creativity.</p>\\n<p>What can you start doing in your daily life to get more creative?

In just a few months I’ve managed to complete 30 projects on <a href=\\\"https://www.freecodecamp.com/\\\">Free Code Camp</a>. I published an <a href=\\\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-doing-something-i-love-landed-me-a-top-tier-tech-internship-fe78d8b74e48#.ovaq3oniu\\\">article</a> about how I landed my first internship. I did this while pursuing a degree in Chemical Engineering on the side. By my standards it’s been a ridiculously productive year.</p>\\n<p>Recently however, I’ve been struggling. It’s not because I no longer have the time or energy, but rather I’m not as motivated. Some days I sit down to code, only to stop fifteen minutes later because it’s not “fun”.</p>\\n<p>“You have to enjoy the process” I tell myself, “If you don’t it’s not worth it”.</p>\\n<p>And so I stop. “Maybe I just need a break from coding”. I started to believe this was true, until I heard a quote from this Food52 podcast.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“You don’t always feel like cooking. I do talk about the joyfulness of cooking, and the pleasure I take in it. But that doesn’t mean to say that I believe it is always pleasurable and it is always joyful”<br><br>\\n-Nigella Lawson</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I find this to be true in so many aspects of my life. I love the feeling of going to the gym to workout. But sometimes I just want to lay in bed and relax for a bit.</p>\\n<p>And that’s okay.</p>\\n<p>But does it mean that I need a break from working out? Most of the time the answer is no. In this modern age it can be easy to be overly romantic about what you spend your life doing. Just because you are following your “passion”, doesn’t mean you have to love every second of your work.</p>\\n<p>Even the people we admire most still spend a lot of their time working on mundane tasks. People rarely talk about the fact that when you become more successful, it doesn’t make it any easier.</p>\\n<p>Tim Ferris describes what he felt while writing <a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357\\\">4-Hour Workweek</a>.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“On good days, I’d settle for the impulse to slam my own head in a car door.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>For years this idea that work isn’t supposed to be fun was commonly accepted. Probably too accepted. Work can and should be fun. But that doesn’t mean that it will always be enjoyable or that we should expect it to be enjoyable.

I enjoyed everything I was doing, but it left little time for reflecting on what to do next.</p>\\n<p>Instead of taking the time to reflect, I subconsciously relied on a heuristic: follow the actions of the people around you. This led me to applying to 8–10 of the best schools I thought I could get into, and eventually choosing one to attend.</p>\\n<p>Despite being burned out from high school and loads of work, I was pumped for college. Like most 18 year-olds I couldn’t wait to taste that sweet freedom.</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, my parents encouraged me to defer for a year and take some time to experience the world before diving into more school. I would get the freedom I was craving without all the dedication that comes with college.</p>\\n<p>It wasn’t too hard to convince me it was the right thing to do.</p>\\n<p>I worked all summer and into the fall at <a href=\\\"http://www.bloomncowicecream.com/\\\">Bloom’n Cow</a> Ice Cream Shop. I was able to save money for my biggest gap year expense: a trip to Central America with <a href=\\\"https://www.carpediemeducation.org/\\\">Carpe Diem Education</a>. After that trip, I went to <a href=\\\"http://snowmountainranch.org/\\\">Snow Mountain Ranch</a> in Colorado to work. They provided me with room, board, a small stipend and a chance to ski at <a href=\\\"https://www.winterparkresort.com/\\\">Winter Park</a> for free. I spent my summer in the white mountains of New Hampshire working at an <a href=\\\"https://www.outdoors.org/\\\">Appalachian Mountain Club</a> (AMC) hut.</p>\\n<p>Some parts of my gap year sucked. I got so sick in Nicaragua that I had to go to a local hospital. I got robbed at gunpoint in Guatemala. I got depressed working in Colorado cleaning toilets for 8 hours a day.</p>\\n<p>But most of it was amazing.</p>\\n<p>I found a passion for cooking. I met people from all over the world. I made lifelong friends and learned so much about myself along the way.\\n\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"alt text\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/1-139d55cef52a1296fcba873a162fc407-631b1.jpeg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/1-139d55cef52a1296fcba873a162fc407-30fbd.jpeg 200w,\\n/static/1-139d55cef52a1296fcba873a162fc407-e87dc.jpeg 400w,\\n/static/1-139d55cef52a1296fcba873a162fc407-631b1.jpeg 800w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>Sunset looking out onto Volcano Concepción</h4>\\n<h2>Back To School</h2>\\n<p>Fast forward to the start of my classes the following year. I still had no idea what I wanted to do. Two months into the semester I had to declare my major.</p>\\n<p>I chose Chemical Engineering out of a vague interest for chemistry and food science. Two years later I can say there is a decent chance that I will never work as a chemical engineer. Many of my classmates have minimal interest in working in the field as well.</p>\\n<p>Luckily for me, I have found a passion for Computer Science (<a href=\\\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-doing-something-i-love-landed-me-a-top-tier-tech-internship-fe78d8b74e48#.voi7w59x1\\\">article</a>). But I still worry that many of those around me will see no other option than to start a career in an industry that they do not enjoy.</p>\\n<h2>How Does This Relate to a Gap Year?</h2>\\n<p>Both as students and as parents, we need to start placing more value on spending our life doing things we enjoy. 70% of U.S employees say they hate their job (<a href=\\\"http://www.medicaldaily.com/i-hate-my-job-say-70-us-employees-how-be-happy-work-319928\\\">source</a>).</p>\\n<p>I believe that a major reason for this is that people do not spend enough time thinking about what they actually want to do.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.williammacaskill.com/\\\">Will MacAskill</a> (co-founder of <a href=\\\"https://80000hours.org/\\\">80,000 hours</a>) has talked about this topic extensively. In life, most of us will have around 80,000 working hours. In the long term, it is an incredible investment to spend at least 4000 hours (2 working years) thinking about how to spend the remaining 95% of working hours.</p>\\n<p>Stop telling your kid that college is a great place to discover your interest. College is expensive and four years goes quickly. If you are like me and many of my classmates, by the time you find your area of interest, it might be too late.</p>\\n<p>Even though I still was not sure what I wanted to do after I finished my gap year, I do believe it has been hugely influential throughout my college experience, and in helping me find an interest in programming.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"alt text\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/2-e0eaf28aaa2e20d7b5957381bf487f6d-b04e1.jpeg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/2-e0eaf28aaa2e20d7b5957381bf487f6d-5a2bc.jpeg 200w,\\n/static/2-e0eaf28aaa2e20d7b5957381bf487f6d-7c8eb.jpeg 400w,\\n/static/2-e0eaf28aaa2e20d7b5957381bf487f6d-b04e1.jpeg 640w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>Telemark Skiing in Colorado</h4>\\n<h2>Working A Crappy Job</h2>\\n<p>I spent forty hours a week in Colorado making beds and cleaning toilets. At the time I hated it, but what I learned about myself in the process has proven invaluable.</p>\\n<p>As <a href=\\\"http://jaronschneider.com/blog/2015/5/13/casey-neistat-nails-it-again-why-you-need-to-work-a-crappy-job\\\">Casey Neistat</a> has mentioned, working a crappy job can prove extremely valuable. When you spend many hours doing something you hate, you will inevitably start spending some of that time dreaming about what you might like to do instead.</p>\\n<p>The earlier that you can have this experience in life, the more beneficial it will be.</p>\\n<h2>What To Do During Your Gap Year</h2>\\n<p>Okay, so you’ve made it this far. Maybe I have even convinced you that taking some time off from school is a good idea. But what the heck are you going to do instead?</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h4>Making chocolate on a farm on Ometepe Island</h4>\\n<p><strong>1. Travel:</strong> Read Vagabonding, and you’ll realize travel doesn’t have to be crazy expensive. Spending time in other countries outside your comfort zone is fantastic for self discovery.</p>\\n<p><strong>2. Work:</strong> I mentioned this earlier but it’s worth repeating. This can help you fund your travel and other experiences, and I guarantee it will make those experiences more rewarding. Knowing that you worked hard to make a trip happen, will make you so much more grateful during the experience. If you find a job you actually enjoy, awesome. Otherwise, just take whatever you can find. Working a job you hate for a few months won’t kill you.</p>\\n<p><strong>3. Learn new skills:</strong> Just because you aren’t enrolled in formal education doesn’t mean you have to stop learning. Start your own blog, attend a coding bootcamp, take courses on Udemy, signup for a cooking class in Thailand. Try stuff out, spend some money, it’s okay to invest in yourself. After all, you’re already saving you and your parents 20,000–60,000 dollars per year by not attending college. Once you find something you love, do it every day and try to improve.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 71.09375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"alt text\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/4-fee7b6fe1270a29155fe8508755c3f71-b04e1.jpeg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/4-fee7b6fe1270a29155fe8508755c3f71-5a2bc.jpeg 200w,\\n/static/4-fee7b6fe1270a29155fe8508755c3f71-7c8eb.jpeg 400w,\\n/static/4-fee7b6fe1270a29155fe8508755c3f71-b04e1.jpeg 640w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>Galehead Hut, in the white mountains.

For fields such as marketing, entrepreneurship, and programming, formal education has a very difficult time keeping up with the rapid developments that are constantly happening.</p>\\n<p>Spend time refining your skills consistently, and you will be well equipped to make a living with this skill.

Since then I’ve built numerous <a href=\\\"https://github.com/twmilli?tab=repositories\\\">projects</a>, completed over 1000 hours worth of coursework on <a href=\\\"https://www.freecodecamp.com/\\\">Free Code Camp</a>, and accepted my first internship working at <a href=\\\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/\\\">Braintree</a> in San Francisco.</p>\\n<p>Although many people have achieved similar successes without too much effort, I think it’s important to note that I’m currently majoring in chemical engineering at Bucknell, a school consistently ranked outside the top 50 programs for computer science.</p>\\n<p>A little over a year ago, I walked into my first tech interview. The recruiter was from Microsoft, and he was holding an open on-campus interview session. I remember sitting down for the interview, completely naive to the type of questions he would ask me.</p>\\n<p>After a quick introduction, he asked me, “How would you reverse a linked-list?”</p>\\n<p>I paused in an attempt to contain my nervousness, before giving him my vague and clearly fabricated answer. A few minutes later the recruiter thanked me for my time.</p>\\n<p>I left feeling simultaneously embarrassed for having wasting his time, yet exhilarated by what I’d just experienced.</p>\\n<p>I couldn’t believe it. They actually cared about my technical ability to code!</p>\\n<p>It was so refreshing that companies were able to look at something other than my GPA, which school I went to, and my ability to talk your way through behavioral questions. The companies I interviewed with didn’t seem to care that that I was majoring in chemical engineering. They just wanted to see whether I could code.</p>\\n<p>From there I got to work. I sent out nearly 100 applications over the next month. I was willing to take any opportunity available.\\nAs of January, I had received nothing but generic rejection emails. Not a single interview!</p>\\n<p>But I couldn’t really blame them. I was a chemical engineering major and my only relevant experience was taking two introductory computer science courses. So I decided my best option was to accept a summer research position in my school’s chemical engineering department.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQBBf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHnYFyBX//EABcQAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEAP/2gAIAQEAAQUCgzQqL//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8BP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EABcQAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQIGH/2gAIAQEABj8Cgcp//8QAGRAAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERITFB/9oACAEBAAE/IUlNHPCZu60YaiKf/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABCwz//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8QP//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEf/aAAgBAgEBPxBsf//EABsQAAMBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESExQVFh/9oACAEBAAE/EGdlj9hoHC0p0/PYxJrJ9IDtpXp//9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"alt text\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/1-20152a612c5c6d66c9b0d4f628cc5735-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/1-20152a612c5c6d66c9b0d4f628cc5735-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/1-20152a612c5c6d66c9b0d4f628cc5735-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/1-20152a612c5c6d66c9b0d4f628cc5735-631b1.jpg 800w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>photo by <a href=\\\"https://unsplash.com/@iamkiran\\\">Sai Kiran Anagani</a></h4>\\n<p>On the outside, it felt like I was giving up.

In my head, I vowed that next year would be different.</p>\\n<p>Over winter break, I worked my way through an Android programming course on <a href=\\\"https://www.udemy.com/\\\">Udemy</a>.

Most days I would wake up thinking about my current project, excited about the features I would be working on. But there were definitely some exceptions.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work.”\\n― Stephen King</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>On these days I would usually force myself to code for at least 30 minutes. Most of the time after the 30 minutes I was immersed and happy to continue. But if not, I gave myself complete permission to stop and move away from the computer for the rest of the night.</p>\\n<p>I also made a point to spend every Saturday or Sunday off campus in nature with friends. As Cal Newport talks about in <a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692\\\">Deep Work</a>, spending time in nature away from technology has been shown to have rejuvenating effects.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"alt text\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/3-5eae7aac005fd2c488bc160370dcfec7-631b1.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/3-5eae7aac005fd2c488bc160370dcfec7-30fbd.jpg 200w,\\n/static/3-5eae7aac005fd2c488bc160370dcfec7-e87dc.jpg 400w,\\n/static/3-5eae7aac005fd2c488bc160370dcfec7-631b1.jpg 800w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>The article didn’t seem complete without a sweaty picture of me doing a headstand in the alps</h4>\\n<p>It’s also worth noting that I took two weeks off from work and coding in the middle of the summer to take a family vacation hiking in the alps.</p>\\n<p>From the end of May until now, I’ve pushed code to my <a href=\\\"https://github.com/twmilli\\\">GitHub</a> more than 250 times.</p>\\n<h2>The Hunt</h2>\\n<p>By the end of the summer, I had built 21 new front-end websites to show off.

I had recently read <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@hosseeb\\\">Haseeb Qureshi’s</a> article on <a href=\\\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation-c46bb9bc7dea#.qtddaiju5\\\">salary negotiation</a> and I decided to take his advice. I cold-emailed a few of my “dream” companies and let them know that I had just received an offer, but that I would rather work for them.</p>\\n<p>A few days later, a recruiter at Braintree responded to my message. A similar process ensued: coding challenge -> phone interview -> another trip to Chicago.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 740px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.62162162162161%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"alt text\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/5-141bce588049334ebbe0571dde09b6da-c89c6.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/5-141bce588049334ebbe0571dde09b6da-fbf4e.png 200w,\\n/static/5-141bce588049334ebbe0571dde09b6da-837da.png 400w,\\n/static/5-141bce588049334ebbe0571dde09b6da-c89c6.png 740w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h4>It didn’t hurt that the office was pretty sweet…</h4>\\n<p>In my taxi from the office back to the airport, I got another call. They wanted to extend an offer. I accepted shortly after, and negotiated to work at their office in San Francisco.</p>\\n<h2>Lessons learned along the way</h2>\\n<h3>Lesson #1: I didn’t get the internship because I’m a genius, or a naturally gifted programmer. I got it because I put in the time and hard work.</h3>\\n<p>A non-chemical engineering major who was passionate about chemistry could have gone through a similar process to my coding regiment and become a better chemical engineer than I will ever be.</p>\\n<p>If you start focusing on things you enjoy, you’ll have a huge advantage over everyone else.</p>\\n<h3>Lesson #2: Don’t be afraid to set goals that seem out of reach.</h3>\\n<p>Bold goals are exciting. The rush you get when taking action to reach your goal will far outweigh the downside that you might not reach it.\\nEven if you fall short, you will get further than you would have otherwise.</p>\\n<h3>Lesson #3: Try something new.</h3>\\n<p>I had no idea that I would fall in love with programming a year ago.</p>\\n<p>Be willing to take a chance and try something out of your comfort zone, you just might find something you love.</p>\\n<p>Some resources I’ve found helpful</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/\\\">Software Engineering
