>> "Drinking is borrowing happiness from tomorrow" - Matt Mullenweg

I love this quote.  Similarly, I think many "type A" people, including myself have a tendency to borrow happiness from today, in hopes of happiness in the future.

We call it delayed gratification.  Long-term thinking.  Society praises this delayed gratification and criticizes the short-term thinking of alcohol consumption.  But nothing you do today will make you happy tomorrow, and nothing you do tomorrow will make you happy today.

There are a place for both these things.  I personally love to drink alcohol on occasion.  I love to dream about the future and work hard to make these dreams come true.  But in excess both are extraordinarily dangerous.  I'd rather just be high on today.
